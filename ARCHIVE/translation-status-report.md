# Translation Status Report - Critical Issues Identified

## Problem Summary
The translation tasks are not completing the full corpus as required. Analysis shows:

### Original Requirements
- **Source**: 5,458,199 characters (124,456 lines)
- **Target**: Complete translations in 4 languages  
- **Expectation**: Files of comparable size (~4-5MB each)

### Actual Results
- **Japanese**: 6,278 lines total (~5% of required size)
- **Spanish**: 6,731 lines total (~5% of required size)  
- **Italian**: 3,198 lines total (~3% of required size)
- **French**: Need to verify

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Task Scope Misunderstanding**: Agents are creating representative samples instead of complete translations
2. **Processing Limitations**: Large file processing may be hitting limits
3. **Instruction Clarity**: Need more explicit "process every line" instructions
4. **Validation Gap**: No automated checking for completion percentage

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Restart Strategy
- Create new tasks with explicit character count targets
- Implement progress checkpoints
- Add validation requirements

### 2. Alternative Approach
- Process in smaller verified chunks with overlap
- Combine outputs to create complete translations
- Implement automated size verification

### 3. Quality Assurance
- File size validation (minimum 3-4MB per language)
- Line count validation (minimum 80,000 lines per language)  
- Content sampling to verify completeness

## Recommendation
Before proceeding to proofreading and JLPT annotation phases, we must ensure all base translations are actually complete. The current files are insufficient for the reconciliation process.
