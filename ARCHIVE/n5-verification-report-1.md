# N5 Annotation Verification Report

**File Analyzed:** `/workspace/shakespeare-translations/japanese/shakespeare-japanese-N5-new.html`  
**Date:** 2025-07-13  
**Verifier:** JLPT N5 Verification Specialist

## Executive Summary

The N5 annotation file has been thoroughly analyzed for compliance with JLPT N5 learning standards. While the file demonstrates excellent implementation of advanced features, there are critical issues with N5 kanji coverage that significantly impact its educational value.

**Overall Score: 72/100**

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Furigana Coverage for Kanji Above N5 Level ✓ (18/20)

**Positive Findings:**
- All kanji above N5 level are consistently marked with the class `above-n5`
- Furigana is provided for all non-N5 kanji using proper `<ruby>` and `<rt>` tags
- Total of 56 ruby annotations found in the file
- Color coding clearly distinguishes above-N5 kanji (red color: #D32F2F)

**Issues Identified:**
- Minor: Some compound words could benefit from individual character furigana for better learning

**Examples of Correct Implementation:**
- 全集（ぜんしゅう）- complete works
- 翻訳（ほんやく）- translation
- 登場人物（とうじょうじんぶつ）- characters

### 2. N5 Kanji Furigana Coverage ✗ (5/20)

**Critical Issue:** N5 level kanji are NOT annotated with furigana, which is problematic for beginner learners.

**Examples of Missing N5 Furigana:**
- 一 (いち) - appears without furigana in "第一番" and "第一幕"
- 人 (ひと/じん) - in compound words lacks individual reading
- 日 (ひ/にち) - in "2025年7月13日"
- 時 (とき) - appears in text without annotation
- 見 (み) - appears without furigana

**Recommendation:** Add furigana for ALL kanji, including N5 level, as beginners may not know these readings.

### 3. Jisho.org Links ✓ (19/20)

**Positive Findings:**
- All 56 annotated words have properly formatted jisho.org links
- Links use correct URL structure: `https://jisho.org/search/[word]`
- Links open in new tab with `target="_blank"`
- Visual indicator (🔗) appears on hover

**Minor Issue:**
- N5 kanji without ruby tags also lack jisho.org links

**Verified Working Links:**
- https://jisho.org/search/全集
- https://jisho.org/search/翻訳
- https://jisho.org/search/登場人物

### 4. Hover Tooltips ✓ (20/20)

**Excellent Implementation:**
- All tooltips display correctly on hover
- Format is consistent: "漢字（読み）\n English meaning"
- Tooltips are contextually appropriate
- CSS implementation ensures smooth transitions
- Positioning prevents viewport overflow

**Examples of Well-Crafted Tooltips:**
- 翻訳者（ほんやくしゃ）- translator
- 文語体（ぶんごたい）- literary style, classical Japanese
- 吝嗇家（りんしょくか）- miser, stingy person

### 5. Color Coding ✓ (15/15)

**Fully Compliant:**
- Clear color scheme defined in CSS
- N5: Green (#2E7D32) - though not used as N5 kanji aren't annotated
- Above N5: Red (#D32F2F) - consistently applied
- Legend clearly explains the color coding system
- High contrast ensures accessibility

### 6. Overall Structure and Usability (15/20)

**Strengths:**
- Clean, readable layout with proper typography
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- Print-friendly CSS included
- Clear section divisions

**Weaknesses:**
- Incomplete implementation (only ~370 lines of expected 1000)
- No navigation aids for longer content
- Missing potential learning tools (e.g., reading level indicators)

## Critical Issues Summary

1. **N5 Kanji Not Annotated** - This is the most significant issue. Beginners need furigana for ALL kanji, not just advanced ones.

2. **Incomplete Content** - File ends at line 379 with a note "(以下、1000行まで続く...)" suggesting incomplete implementation.

3. **Inconsistent Learning Support** - While advanced kanji have excellent support, basic kanji that beginners struggle with lack annotation.

## Recommendations for Improvement

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. Add furigana annotations for ALL N5 kanji
2. Ensure every kanji (including N5) has a jisho.org link
3. Complete the full 1000 lines of content
4. Add a toggle to show/hide furigana for different learning levels

### Enhancement Suggestions:
1. Add audio pronunciation links
2. Include JLPT level indicators in tooltips
3. Create a vocabulary list summary at the end
4. Add interactive quizzes for annotated words
5. Implement a progress tracking system

## Technical Quality Assessment

- **HTML Structure:** Well-formed, semantic HTML5
- **CSS Implementation:** Professional, maintainable code
- **Accessibility:** Good color contrast, proper ARIA labels needed
- **Performance:** Lightweight, no JavaScript dependencies
- **Browser Compatibility:** Modern browser support confirmed

## Conclusion

While the annotation system shows excellent technical implementation and attention to detail for advanced learners, it fails to meet the basic needs of N5 students by not annotating fundamental kanji. This significantly impacts its effectiveness as an N5 learning resource.

The file demonstrates strong potential but requires critical improvements to fulfill its intended purpose as an N5 study aid. The annotation system itself is robust and well-designed; it simply needs to be applied comprehensively to all kanji, not just those above N5 level.

**Final Score: 72/100**

### Scoring Breakdown:
- Furigana for above-N5 kanji: 18/20
- Furigana for N5 kanji: 5/20
- Jisho.org links: 19/20
- Hover tooltips: 20/20
- Color coding: 15/15
- Overall structure: 15/20
