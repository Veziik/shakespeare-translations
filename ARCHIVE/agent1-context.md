## Translation Decisions Made

### Character Name Conventions Applied
- Antony → Antonio (following Spanish tradition)

- Eros → Eros (maintained)
- Thyreus → Tireo (hispanicized)

### Linguistic Choices
- Used formal "usted" forms and "tú" according to character relationships and dramatic context
- Maintained blank verse structure where possible using Spanish hendecasyllable patterns
- Preserved Shakespeare's distinction between verse and prose speech patterns
- Adapted idiomatic expressions while maintaining poetic quality
- Used archaic Spanish forms (e.g., "mas" instead of "pero") for elevated speech

### Cultural Adaptations

- Maintained military terminology appropriate to Roman context

### Dramatic Intensity Preservation
- Maintained the emotional arc of characters
- Preserved the contrast between Antonio's noble language and moments of despair
- Kept Cleopatra's regal bearing and emotional complexity
- Maintained the political tension and military urgency

### Poetic Meter Considerations
- For Sonnets: Used endecasílabos (11-syllable verses) to match iambic pentameter
- For plays: Mixed endecasílabos with alejandrinos where needed
- Maintained line breaks and dramatic pauses from original
- Preserved the musical quality of Shakespeare's language through careful word choice
- Used Spanish synonyms that maintain both meaning and rhythm

### Challenges Encountered

3. **Cultural Context**: Maintaining Roman/Egyptian cultural references while making them accessible to Spanish readers
4. **Dramatic Intensity**: Preserving the emotional weight of key speeches and dramatic moments
